### Aspiring Web Developer

Welcome to my Github. I am Alex Bradshaw, an aspiring full stack web developer. My studies have led me to take a six month bootcamp for coding and I now have projects to fill my github. Below are my projects. Every week I'm updating it further and it will soon include projects with mySQL, nodejs, etc. At the moment it is just Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
