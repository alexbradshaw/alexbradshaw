### Aspiring Web Developer

Welcome to my Github. I am Alex Bradshaw, an aspiring full stack web developer. My studies have led me to take a six month bootcamp for coding and I now have projects to fill my github. Below are my projects. Every week I'm updating it further and my projects currently contain Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Mongodb/Mongoose, MySQL/Sequelize, Handlebars.js, and Express.js.
